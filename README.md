# f1tenth_stanley_controller_aneesh
This repository contains my attempt to implement the Stanley controller in the F1TENTH gym environment. I have some basic knowledge of ROS2, and through this project Iâ€™m aiming to deepen my understanding while also getting comfortable with GitHub. After completing the software implementation, I plan to extend this work to hardware.
